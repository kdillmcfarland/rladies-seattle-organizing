# Welcome to R-Ladies Seattle! 

We'd love to hear from you about which topics and speakers you'd like to see at upcoming [R-Ladies Seattle](https://rladiesseattle.org/) meetups. You can help us out be sharing your thoughts in the [issues](https://github.com/rladies-seattle/rladies-seattle-organizing/issues) for this repository.

R-Ladies Seattle is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Seattle exists to promote diversity in the R community, both in the US and worldwide. We hold meetups every 1 - 2 months to share knowledge that is relevant to our community and consistent with our vision and mission.

Meetups are a place for members to expand their R knowledge, get experience with public speaking, and connect with other R-Ladies Seattle members. They are typically 1 - 2 hours long and can take the form of talks (20 - 30 min each), shorter "ligthning" talks, workshops, tutorials, and social events.
