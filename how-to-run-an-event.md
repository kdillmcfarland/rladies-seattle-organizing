How to host an R-Ladies Seattle event
==========================

## Types of events we host

In the past, we've hosted these types of events:

* Lightning Talks
* Workshops/Tutorials
* Talks (typically 20 min - 40 min)
* Hacknight
* Social

If you have an idea for a new type of event, talk with the organizers about how to set it up.

## Finding speakers

There are a few ways you can find speakers:

* Post a call for speakers on the R-Ladies Slack or Twitter accounts.
* Message the R-Ladies meetup.com group.
* Reach out to people in your network or the networks of other R-Ladies Seattle members.
* You can give a talk! Chat with the organizers if you have questions about what to present. 

We also have a speaker interest form. 

## Finding a venue

We've found spaces to host our events through some of the same strategies we've found speakers. The organizers have a list of contacts and companies that have partnered with us in the past.

## Posting the event on meetup.com

To create an event on our meetup.com account, you have to be listed on the leadership team on meetup.com. If you're not an organizer and listed on the leadership team, ask an organizer to create a draft of the event. Then, they can add you as an event host and you'll be able to edit the event and message attendees.

The event posting should contain:

* Fun, descriptive title
* 1-3 sentence overview of topic
* 1-2 sentence bio of speakers (not necessary for lightning talks)
* Details: location, directions (how to get in building), food availability, duration
* A picture is nice!

## Running the event

Arrive at the venue 15-30 minutes early to set up the room. Check projector, microphone, laptop connections, etc. if necessary. 

Bring name tags for attendees. Name tags should have space for names and pronouns. 

As people are arriving, it's nice to have a slide up that explains when the meeting will begin, what to do while waiting (e.g., find food or any setup steps for a tutorial), and how to connect to wifi. 

Begin the meeting with a few intro slides. First, welcome attendees, state the mission of R-Ladies, point people to the R-Ladies Slack/Twitter/etc., mention code of conduct. Then review today's topic and introduce the speakers.
