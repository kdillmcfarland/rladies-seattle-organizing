How to get involved in R-Ladies Seattle
========================================

1. **Attend an event.** See the [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-seattle) page for upcoming events.

2. **Speak at an event.** Fill out the [speaker interest form](https://forms.gle/jvpp5oCgQb64Kqta6), or get in contact with an organizer on Slack or email.

3. **Join the Slack channel.** There is a R-Ladies Seattle Slack channel and a R-Ladies Community (global) Slack channel. This is a good place to get R help, post questions, post and look for job opportunities, and connect with other R-Ladies members. Email seattle@rladies.org for an invite link.

4. **Ask your company to host R-Ladies Seattle.** Does your company/organization/school have space for a large group to meet? Typically we see up to 30 people at events.

5. **Ask your company to sponsor or donate to R-Ladies Seattle and R-Ladies Global.** Right now R-Ladies Seattle accepts in-kind donations like food for events and event space. Donations can be made to [R-Ladies global](https://rladies.org/), the larger non-profit that pays for R-Ladies Seattle's meet-up account fees and other organizing costs.

6. **Help us organize an event.** E-mail the Seattle organizing team to see how you can get involved in organizing events and reaching out to speakers. The co-organizers are using [Github issues for this repo](https://github.com/rladies-seattle/rladies-seattle-organizing/issues) to plan events, so you can look and comment there if you're looking to get involved in organizing. More information on how to run an event is [here](how-to-run-an-event.md).
